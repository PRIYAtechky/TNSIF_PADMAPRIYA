# TNSIF_PADMAPRIYA 💻

Let's learn, understand, and develop Java projects using the training provided by the **TNSIF program**, powered by **Capgemini**. This repository contains my Java programming practice and demonstration projects, created as part of the TNSIF training program. It includes well-organized examples covering core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts along with other fundamental Java topics.

Beyond technical learning, this journey also focuses on **soft skills and personal growth** — helping us become our best versions. The **interpersonal skills sessions** emphasized that real progress goes beyond coding, shaping us to grow both **technically and personally**. 🌟
