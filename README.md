# TNSIF_PADMAPRIYA

Let's learn, understand, and develop Java projects using the training provided by the **TNSIF program**, powered by **Capgemini**. This repository contains my Java programming practice and demonstration projects, created as part of the TNSIF training program. It includes well-organized examples covering core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts along with other fundamental Java topics.

Beyond technical learning, this journey also focuses on **soft skills and personal growth**, Empowering to become the best version.. The **interpersonal skills sessions** emphasized that real progress goes beyond coding, shaping us to grow both **technically and personally**. 🌟

| Topic                  | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Encapsulation          | getters, setters, and data protection.<br>Controls access to class data and protects it from unauthorized modification. |
| Abstraction            | abstract classes, methods, and runtime polymorphism.<br>Hides implementation details to focus on functionality. |
| Inheritance            | single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.<br>Allows classes to reuse code from other classes. |
| Polymorphism           | method overloading and method overriding.<br>Enables the same method to behave differently based on context. |
| Interfaces             | creating and implementing interfaces.<br>Defines contracts that classes must follow. |
| Exception Handling     | try-catch blocks and error management.<br>Handles runtime errors to prevent program crashes. |
| Threading              | using Thread class and methods like run(), start(), sleep(), join(), isAlive(), and setPriority() for concurrent execution.<br>Allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously. |
| Collections Framework  | working with List, Set, Queue, Map, Vector, Stack, and Iterator for efficient data management.<br>Organizes and manages groups of objects efficiently. |
| lambda                 | Provides a concise way to represent anonymous functions for functional programming. |
| streamapi              | Processes collections of data in a functional and efficient way. |
| Junit                  | Used for writing unit tests to check and validate Java code. |
| Hands-on Exercises     | practical programs and examples for learning.<br>Helps reinforce Java concepts through practice. |
